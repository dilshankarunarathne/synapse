## Abstract

The GOD is a web-based application that provides a platform for users to create software applications without having to code. 

The application operates in a 'wizard' mode where users can navigate through and enter their preferences for various types of software projects. This includes, but is not limited to, websites, web applications, APIs, machine learning projects, and mobile applications. The goal is to make the process of creating software as user-friendly and accessible as possible, even for those without a background in coding.

The GOD uses a combination of machine learning algorithms and natural language processing to understand user preferences and generate code based on those preferences. The application also provides a user-friendly interface for users to interact with their projects, including the ability to customize and modify the generated code.

## Future Improvements

In the future, we plan to improve this application to a point where users won't need to use a wizard mode or a UI. Instead, they can simply talk to the AI. The AI will interpret and understand the user's requirements and build the software accordingly. This will further simplify the process of creating software, making it even more accessible to users without a background in coding.
