Synapse is a Domain-Specific Language (DSL) designed to simplify collaborative task execution on resource-constrained 
devices at the edge of the network.

## Project Overview

Traditional edge computing approaches rely on individual device capabilities. Synapse takes a different approach: 
it enables devices to work together, leveraging their combined processing power to handle complex tasks efficiently.

### This project aims to develop

User-friendly DSL: Synapse provides a concise and intuitive way to define tasks suitable for distributed execution on 
edge devices.
- Secure Communication Protocol: This protocol ensures secure device discovery, task distribution, data exchange, and 
collaboration among participating devices.
- Scalable and Fault-Tolerant System: The paradigm can adapt to dynamic edge environments by handling device 
availability fluctuations and potential failures.

### Benefits

- Improved Processing Power: By leveraging collaboration, Synapse overcomes limitations of individual devices, enabling 
execution of complex tasks at the edge.
- Reduced Latency: Processing data closer to the source minimizes network hops, leading to lower latency for real-time 
edge applications.
- Scalability: The paradigm scales effortlessly as new devices join the network, automatically distributing workload 
without expensive upgrades.
- Simplified Development: The Synapse DSL simplifies task definition for developers, reducing the barrier to entry for 
edge computing projects.

## Getting Started

This repository is currently under development.

# Future Improvements

Development of the Synapse DSL syntax and compiler.
Design and implementation of the secure communication protocol.
Exploration and integration of scalability and fault tolerance mechanisms.
Development of tools and libraries for efficient task execution on edge devices.
