## Stages of Communication

1. User Creates Job:
   - User defines the task using Synapse DSL in the software client.
   - The client interacts with a central server (optional) for - job registration and device discovery.

2. Job Registration and Device Discovery:
   - The central server assigns a unique and temporary job ID (not the creator's IP) for the task.
   - Devices periodically broadcast their availability and capabilities to the server.
   - The server maintains a list of available devices for each job.

3. Device Joins Task:

   - Devices discover available tasks (and their job IDs) from the server.
   - A device interested in joining a task retrieves the job details from the server.
   - The server facilitates secure communication channel establishment between the creator and joining device using a secure communication protocol like yours.

4. Leader Election (Optional):

   - Devices within a task might run a leader election algorithm to choose a leader for coordinating task execution and result aggregation. This can improve efficiency but introduces additional complexity.

5. Task Execution:

   - The creator distributes task snippets (code segments) to participating devices securely.
   - Devices execute their assigned snippets and send results back to the leader or directly to the creator (depending on the workflow).

6. Result Aggregation and Return:

   - The leader (or creator) aggregates the results from all devices.
   - The final processed data or outcome is returned to the user application.

7. Fault Tolerance:

   - Implement mechanisms to handle device failures or network issues. This might involve:
     - Re-assigning tasks to available devices.
     - Resuming execution from the last successful checkpoint.

## Benefits of this Approach:

   - Improved Security: Temporary job IDs and secure communication protocols enhance overall security.

   - Scalability and Discovery: Centralized server-assisted discovery facilitates task management and device participation in large networks.

   - Fault Tolerance: Mechanisms for handling device failures or network issues improve system robustness.

   - Flexibility: The system can be adapted to work with or without a central server depending on the desired deployment scenario (fully decentralized or centralized coordination).

## Next Steps:

1. Refine Job Description:  Define the information contained within the job details retrieved from the server. This might include:

   - Task description (high-level overview)
   - Synapse code snippets for each participating device
   - Expected results format
   - Security parameters for communication

2. Central Server Design (Optional):  If you choose to use a central server, consider its functionalities:

   - Job registration and management
   - Device discovery and availability tracking
   - Secure communication channel facilitation
   - (Optional) Leader election coordination

3. Software Client Development:  Develop the user interface and functionalities for the software client:

   - Writing Synapse code for tasks
   - Submitting jobs and retrieving job details
   - Visualizing results or interacting with task outcomes

4. Communication Protocol Implementation:  Choose a secure communication library (libsodium, NaCl) and implement the protocol for:

   - Device authentication and authorization
   - Encrypted data exchange
   - Message integrity checks

5. Security Considerations:  Thoroughly assess and address security vulnerabilities throughout the system design and implementation.
