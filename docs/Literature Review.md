A Distributed Programming Paradigm for Resource-Constrained Devices with the Introduction of a Domain-Specific Language

## Abstract 

This project proposes a novel distributed programming paradigm specifically designed for resource-constrained devices 
operating at the edge of the network. The paradigm leverages the combined processing power of nearby devices to tackle computationally intensive tasks, overcoming limitations of individual devices. A Domain-Specific Language (DSL) facilitates user-friendly task specification for collaborative execution, while secure communication protocols ensure reliable and efficient data exchange among participating devices. This research aims to develop a scalable and fault-tolerant solution for distributed task execution, enabling efficient processing at the edge with reduced latency.
